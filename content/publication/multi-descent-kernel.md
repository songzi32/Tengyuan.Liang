abstract = "We study the risk of minimum-norm interpolants of data in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space where kernel is defined as a function of the inner product. Our upper bounds on the risk are of a \\emph{multiple-descent} shape for the various scalings of $d = n^{\\alpha}$, $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$, for the input dimension $d$ and sample size $n$. At the heart of our analysis is a study of spectral properties of the random kernel matrix restricted to a filtration of eigen-spaces of the population covariance operator. Since gradient flow on appropriately initialized wide neural networks converges to a minimum-norm interpolant, the analysis also yields estimation guarantees for these models."
