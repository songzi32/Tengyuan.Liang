# Biography

I am an [assistant professor](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/l/tengyuan-liang) at [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu), and the George C. Tiao faculty fellow in data science research.  

I use [learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory) and [mathematical statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_statistics) to understand models and data.

My current research goals include:

- To bridge the empirical and theoretical gap in modern statistical learning;
- To understand the computational and algorithmic aspects of statistical inference;
- To explore the role of stochasticity in solving non-convex optimization.
