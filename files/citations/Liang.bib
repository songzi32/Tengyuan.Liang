  abstract = {We consider the problem of optimizing an approximately convex function over a bounded convex set in \textsuperscript{n} using only function evaluations. The problem is reduced to sampling from an log-concave distribution using the Hit-and-Run method, which is shown to have the same \textsuperscript{*} complexity as sampling from log-concave distributions. In addition to extend the analysis for log-concave distributions to approximate log-concave distributions, the implementation of the 1-dimensional sampler of the Hit-and-Run walk requires new methods and analysis. The algorithm then is based on simulated annealing which does not relies on first order conditions which makes it essentially immune to local minima. We then apply the method to different motivating problems. In the context of zeroth order stochastic convex optimization, the proposed method produces an {$\epsilon$}-minimizer after \textsuperscript{*}(n{$^7$}.5{$\epsilon^-$}2) noisy function evaluations by inducing a ({$\epsilon$}/n)-approximately log concave distribution. We also consider in detail the case when the ``amount of non-convexity'' decays towards the optimum of the function. Other applications of the method discussed in this work include private computation of empirical risk minimizers, two-stage stochastic programming, and approximate dynamic programming for online learning.},

In this paper we consider in the high-dimensional setting optimal estimation of the differential entropy and the log-determinant of the covariance matrix. We first establish a central limit theorem for the log determinant of the sample covariance matrix in the high-dimensional setting where the dimension p(n) can grow with the sample size n. An estimator of the differential entropy and the log determinant is then considered. Optimal rate of convergence is obtained. It is shown that in the case p(n)/n\textrightarrow 0 the estimator is asymptotically sharp minimax. The ultra-high-dimensional setting where p(n)\textquestiondown n is also discussed.},

  abstract = {AbstractConsider the problem: given the data pair (x,y) drawn from a population with f*(x)=E[y|x=x], specify a neural network model and run gradient flow on the weights over time until reaching any stationarity. How does ft, the function computed by the neural network at time t, relate to f*, in terms of approximation and representation? What are the provable benefits of the adaptive representation by neural networks compared to the prespecified fixed basis representation in the classical nonparametric literature? We answer the above questions via a dynamic reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) approach indexed by the training process of neural networks. First, we show that when reaching any local stationarity, gradient flow learns an adaptive RKHS representation and performs the global least-squares projection onto the adaptive RKHS, simultaneously. Second, we prove that as the RKHS is data-adaptive and task-specific, the residual for f* lies in a subspace that is potentially much smaller than the orthogonal complement of the RKHS. The result formalizes the representation and approximation benefits of neural networks. Finally, we show that the neural network function computed by gradient flow converges to the kernel ridgeless regression with an adaptive kernel, in the limit of vanishing regularization. The adaptive kernel viewpoint provides new angles of studying the approximation, representation, generalization, and optimization advantages of neural networks.

The goal is to design an online learning algorithm with sublinear regret to the best sparse linear predictor in hindsight. Without any assumptions, this problem is known to be computationally intractable. In this paper, we make the assumption that data matrix satisfies restricted isometry property, and show that this assumption leads to computationally efficient algorithms with sublinear regret for two variants of the problem. In the first variant, the true label is generated according to a sparse linear model with additive Gaussian noise. In the second, the true label is chosen adversarially.},

We introduce a notion of offset Rademacher complexity that provides a transparent way to study localization both in expectation and in high probability. For any (possibly non-convex) class, the excess loss of a two-step estimator is shown to be upper bounded by this offset complexity through a novel geometric inequality. In the convex case, the estimator reduces to an empirical risk minimizer. The method recovers the results of 15 for the bounded case while also providing guarantees without the boundedness assumption.},

The analysis reveals the surprising nature of the off-diagonal interaction term as both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, this interaction term explains the origin of the slow-down effect in the convergence of Simultaneous Gradient Ascent (SGA) to stable Nash equilibria. On the other hand, for the unstable equilibria, exponential convergence can be proved thanks to the interaction term, for four modified dynamics proposed to stabilize GAN training: Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD), Consensus Optimization (CO), Implicit Updates (IU) and Predictive Method (PM). The analysis uncovers the intimate connections among these stabilizing techniques, and provides detailed characterization on the choice of learning rate. As a by-product, we present a new analysis for OMD proposed in Daskalakis, Ilyas, Syrgkanis, and Zeng [2017] with improved rates.},

  abstract = {Summary Modern statistical inference tasks often require iterative optimization methods to compute the solution. Convergence analysis from an optimization viewpoint informs us only how well the solution is approximated numerically but overlooks the sampling nature of the data. In contrast, recognizing the randomness in the data, statisticians are keen to provide uncertainty quantification, or confidence, for the solution obtained by using iterative optimization methods. The paper makes progress along this direction by introducing moment-adjusted stochastic gradient descent: a new stochastic optimization method for statistical inference. We establish non-asymptotic theory that characterizes the statistical distribution for certain iterative methods with optimization guarantees. On the statistical front, the theory allows for model misspecification, with very mild conditions on the data. For optimization, the theory is flexible for both convex and non-convex cases. Remarkably, the moment adjusting idea motivated from `error standardization' in statistics achieves a similar effect to acceleration in first-order optimization methods that are used to fit generalized linear models. We also demonstrate this acceleration effect in the non-convex setting through numerical experiments.},

Empirical evidence supports our finding that minimum-norm interpolants in RKHS can exhibit this unusual non-monotonicity in sample size; furthermore, locations of the peaks in our experiments match our theoretical predictions. Since gradient flow on appropriately initialized wide neural networks converges to a minimum-norm interpolant with respect to a certain kernel, our analysis also yields novel estimation and generalization guarantees for these over-parametrized models. At the heart of our analysis is a study of spectral properties of the random kernel matrix restricted to a filtration of eigen-spaces of the population covariance operator, and may be of independent interest.},

  abstract = {We study the detailed path-wise behavior of the discrete-time Langevin algorithm for non-convex Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) through the lens of metastability, adopting some techniques from Berglund and Gentz (2003). For a particular local optimum of the empirical risk, with an \emph{arbitrary initialization}, we show that, with high probability, at least one of the following two events will occur: (1) the Langevin trajectory ends up somewhere outside the {$\varepsilon$}-neighborhood of this particular optimum within a short \emph{recurrence time}; (2) it enters this {$\varepsilon$}-neighborhood by the recurrence time and stays there until a potentially exponentially long \emph{escape time}. We call this phenomenon \emph{empirical metastability}. This two-timescale characterization aligns nicely with the existing literature in the following two senses. First, the effective recurrence time (i.e., number of iterations multiplied by stepsize) is dimension-independent, and resembles the convergence time of continuous-time deterministic Gradient Descent (GD). However unlike GD, the Langevin algorithm does not require strong conditions on local initialization, and has the possibility of eventually visiting all optima. Second, the scaling of the escape time is consistent with the Eyring-Kramers law, which states that the Langevin scheme will eventually visit all local minima, but it will take an exponentially long time to transit among them. We apply this path-wise concentration result in the context of statistical learning to examine local notions of generalization and optimality.},
